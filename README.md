# Projects List (Frontend)

This repository contains the frontend for my personal **Projects List** site. It serves as a lightweight reference point and a place to maintain version control as the site evolves over time.

The project is mostly static and intentionally simple—built to showcase and organize various projects in a clean, minimal interface. While it’s not actively developed, this repo exists so future updates, redesigns, or integrations can be tracked properly.

## Purpose

* Keep a version-controlled record of the site’s code.
* Provide an easy reference for future modifications.
* Serve as the base for potential improvements or rewrites later on.

## Notes

* Frontend-only.
* No backend dependencies.
* Safe to fork, clone, or adapt if needed.
